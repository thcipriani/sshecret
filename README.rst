If you have an encrypted ssh key for each domain you access (you should), and
you keep your unlocked keys in a single ssh-agent (you maybe shouldn't),
**AND** you've ever decided you need to forward your ssh-agent, then you should
feel bad.

If you forward an ssh-agent with all your unique keys for every domain to a ssh
server that is compromised - all those unique keys for all those unique domains
you access?  **Kablooie!** Done. Have fun rotating them all.

``sshecret`` is a tool that creates an ssh-agent for each identity file found
in your ``ssh_config(5)`` and executes ssh commands for a particular host using
an environment that has access to **only the key for that one host**.

If a server to which you've forwarded your ssh-agent is compromised, then only
the key used for that domain will be affected.

``sshecret`` is a wrapper around ssh that automatically manages multiple
``ssh-agent(1)`` sockets each containing only a single unlocked ssh key.
``sshecret`` accepts the same parameters as ``ssh(1)`` - fundamentally
``sshecret`` uses ``execve(2)`` to wrap ssh, modifying the environment to
ensure that each key in your ``ssh_config(5)`` uses its own ssh-agent.

Install
-------

Install via pip::

    pip install --user sshecret

Install manually / via APT:

    apt-get install python3-paramiko

    git clone https://github.com/thcipriani/sshecret/

    cp sshecret.py /usr/local/bin/sshecret   
    
Wherever ssh is accepted
------------------------

To use ``sshecret`` with git, point ``GIT_SSH`` to use ``sshecret`` by adding
this to your shell initialization file (``~/.bashrc`` or the like)::

    if command -v sshecret > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        export GIT_SSH=sshecret
    fi

To use ``sshecret`` with scp add this alias to your shell initialization file::

    if command -v sshecret > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        alias scp='scp -S sshecret'
    fi

Limitations
-----------

``sshecret`` obviously won't help you if you're using the same ssh key for
multiple domains. You are clearly beyond help.

``sshecret`` depends on a correct ``ssh_config(5)`` for your user (found at
``~/.ssh/config`` or wherever ``$SSH_CONF`` is pointing), so it'll get weird if
that file is weird or nonexistent. Sorry, I guess.

**Requirements**:

* Paramiko_

.. _Paramiko: http://www.paramiko.org/

**Usage**::

  usage: sshecret [whatever you want to pass to ssh]

  sshecret is a wrapper around ssh that automatically manages multiple
  ssh-agent(1)s each containing only a single ssh key.

      EXAMPLE: sshecret -A -L8080:localhost:80 -l johndoe -p2222 example.com

  sshecret accepts the same parameters as ssh(1) - fundamentally sshecret uses
  execve(2) to wrap ssh, modifying the environment to ensure that each key in
  your ssh_config(5) uses its own ssh- agent.

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    -v          Increase verbosity of output
